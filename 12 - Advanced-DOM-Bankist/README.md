> - _DOM three is genereted from an HTML document, which can interact with. DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree ,_
>   _**What is a DOM tree?** DOM tree like structure made out of nodes. In the DOM there are different types of nodes. ,_
> - **How the DOM API is organized behind the scenes ?** Each node is represented in Javascript by an object. This object gets access to special node methods and properties, such as text content, child nodes, parent nodes and many others ,\_
> - _Node type has a couple of child types. These are the element type, the text type, the comment type and also the document type. The Element type has internally an HTML element and that element type itself has exactly one child type that exists in HTML. Like buttons, links, img etc. ,_
> - _There is a special node type called EventTarget which is a parent of both the node type and window node type has addEventListener() method and all nodes type inherits this method ,_
