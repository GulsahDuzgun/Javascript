### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> - _forEach is a high-order function. forEach calls the callback function which takes as an argument in every iteration. What forEach method does is to loop ever the array and in each iteration it will execute the callback function. Also in each iteration it passes element as an argument to callback function.,_
> - _**What difference is there between forEach and for of loop? ** You can not break out of a forEach loop,continue and breal statements don't work any forEach loop at all. forEach will always loop over the entire array. for of loop allows us to break out loop. ,_
> - _forEach with Maps and Sets ,_
> - _insertAdjacentHTML() method in Javascript,_
> - _**What is map() method in Javascript?** map() returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements. It returns an array.,_
> - _**What is filter() method in Javascript?** filter() returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition.It returns an array.,_
> - _**What is reduce() method in Javascript?** reduce() boils('reduces') all array elements down to one single value. It returns a variable. ,_
> - _find() method in Javascript. We can use find() method to retrieve one element of an array based on a condition.find() method needs a callback function that returns a Boolean. It doesn't return an array, it returns the first element in the array that fits the condition,_
> - _findIndex() method in Javascript,_
> - _includes() and some() method in Javascript. includes()is more likely to use find a certain value -Equality- and we use some() to know there is any value fit the condition we described. ,_
