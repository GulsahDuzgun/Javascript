> - _forEach is a high-order function. forEach calls the callback function which takes as an argument in every iteration. What forEach method does is to loop ever the array and in each iteration it will execute the callback function. Also in each iteration it passes element as an argument to callback function.,_
> - _**What difference is there between forEach and for of loop? ** You can not break out of a forEach loop,continue and breal statements don't work any forEach loop at all. forEach will always loop over the entire array. for of loop allows us to break out loop. ,_
