### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> #
>
> - _**What is Synchronous code in Javascript?** Synchronous code is executed line by line. Each line of code waits for previous line to finish. Long-running operations block code execution. ,_
> - _**What is Asynchronous code in Javascript?** Asynchronous means not occurring at the same time, it means coordinating behavior of a program over a period of time. Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes. Asynchronous code is non-blocking and execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work. Callback functions by themselves don't make code asychronous. The matter is which event is used. We defer an action into the future making the code asynchronous and non-blocking ,_
> - _**What is AJAX?** **A**synchronous **J**avascript **A**nd **X**ML: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically. ,_
> - _**What is an API?** **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface : Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk each other and exchange information. ,_
