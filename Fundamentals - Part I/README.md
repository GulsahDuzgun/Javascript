### What did I learn while coding this project

> #
>
> - _JS has two types of value type (Object and Primitive),_
> - _the 7 primitive data types in Javascript (Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt),_
> - _Javascript has dynamic typing. We dont have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are determined automatically,_
> - _let could be mutate but const couldn't,_
> - _operator precedence in Javascript_
> - _difference between String and Template Literals,_
> - _if-else statements,_
