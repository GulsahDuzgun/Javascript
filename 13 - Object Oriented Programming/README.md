### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> #
>
> - _What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm(how we write and organize code) based on the concept of objects.,_
> - _We use objects to model or describe real word or abstract features. Objects may contain data(properties) and code(methods). By using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behavior into one block. In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code and objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another. This interactions happen through a public interface(API):methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object. ,_
> - _OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code to make it more flexible and easier to maintain(avoid "spaghetti code") ,_
> - _We use class to generate, create objects. Class can be thought as a blueprint which can then be used to create new objects based on the rules described in the class. We call all objects created through a class instances of that class. Class is just a plan and instance is a real object that we can use in our code which was created from a class. ,_
> - _**How do we actually design classes? How do we model real-word data into classes?** There are four fundamental OOP Principles that can guide us toward a good class implementation. These principles are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism ,_
> - _**What is Abstraction?** Abstraction means to ignore or hide details that don't matter. This allows us to get an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation. ,_
> - _**What is Encapsulation?** Encapsulation means to keep properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside of the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface which we call API. **Why private methods and properties exist?** Because that prevents external code from accidentally manipulating internal properties/state and allows us to change internal implementation without the risk of breaking external code. ,_
> - _**What is Inheritance?** Inheritance makes all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class which forms a hierarchy between these two classes. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-word relationships.Child class extends parent class. Child class has some methods and properties from its parent and some of its own ,_
> - _**What is Polymorphism?** Polymorphism means "many shapes" . A child class can overwrite a method that it inherited from a parent class ,_
