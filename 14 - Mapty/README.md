## Mapty

Mapty is a website hosted on Netlify. You can keep your sport activity registered and also you can describe its type as running or cycling. When you allow the browser and it loads the map, you can click the map. If you click the map, the form will be opened and Mapty will calculate the speed or the pace value acording to your sport type. If you cliked an activity in your list, the map will display that location. You can try by clicking <strong>[ Mapty ](https://mapty-gldn.netlify.app/)</strong>.

#### Technologies Used:
