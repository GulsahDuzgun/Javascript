### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> - _default parameters -if the parameters would be set default value, we can use undefined as value- in Javascript,_
> - _**What is First-Class Functions?** Javascript treats functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions are simply values. Functions are just another "type" of object ,_
> - _**What is Higher-Order Functions?** This is only possible because of first-class functions. A function that receives another function as an argument(like addEventListener()), that returns a new function or both.,_
> - _callback functions in Javascript ,_
> - _call() and apply() methods ,_
