### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> #

> - _default parameters -if the parameters would be set default value, we can use undefined as value- in Javascript,_
> - _**What is First-Class Functions?** Javascript treats functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions are simply values. Functions are just another "type" of object ,_
> - _**What is Higher-Order Functions?** This is only possible because of first-class functions. A function that receives another function as an argument(like addEventListener()), that returns a new function or both.,_
> - _callback functions in Javascript ,_
> - _call() and apply() methods ,_
> - _the bind() method,_
> - _Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) ,_
> - _ **What is Closure in Javascript?** A closure is the closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after execution context is gone. A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preservers the the scope chain throughout time. A closure makes sure that function doesn't loose connection to variables that existed at the function's birth place and closure is like a backpack that a function carries around wherever it goes. This backpack has all the variables that were present in the environment where the function was created. We don't manually create closures, this is a Javascript feature that happens automatically. We can't even access closed-over variables explicitly.Closure has priority according to scope chain. A closure is not a tangible Javascript object. ,_
