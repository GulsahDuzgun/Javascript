### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> - _**What is destructuring?** Destructuring is an ESX feature and it is a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables. Destructuring is to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable. So for arrays we use destructuring to retrieve elements from the array and store them into variables,_

> - _The Spread Operator(...) for unpacking all the array elements at one.It takes all the elements out of array.The Spread Operator works on all iterables. Iterables are arrays, strings, maps, sets but not objects.The most built-in data structure in Javascript are iterables but expect objects.,_
> - _Iterables: arrays, strings, maps, sets. NOT objects. We can work with the spread operators on iterables. It gives us mutiple values seperate by a comma and these value is usually used when we pass arguments into a a function or when we build an array.,_
> - _The Rest Patterns uses exact same syntax to collect mutiple elements and condense them into an array. Rest Pattern is opposite of the spread operator.The Spread operator unpacks an array while rest packs elements into an array.The Spread operator is the right side of equal sign but the rest operator is the left side of equal sign. The Rest element doesn't include skip element and the last element should be the rest operator. There is only one rest operator in ant destructuring assignment. ,_
> - _Short Circuiting (&& and ||) the OR operator will return the first truthy value of all the operands or simply the last value if all of them are falsy. The And operator will return the first falsy value or the last value if all of them are truthy. We can use OR operator to ser default values and we can use the AND operator to execute code in the second operand,_
