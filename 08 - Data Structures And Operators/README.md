### What did I learn while coding this project ?

> - _**What is destructuring?** Destructuring is an ESX feature and it is a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables. Destructuring is to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable. So for arrays we use destructuring to retrieve elements from the array and store them into variables,_
> - _destructuring arrays,_
> - _destructuring objects,_
> - _The Spread Operator(...) for unpacking all the array elements at one.It takes all the elements out of array.The Spread Operator works on all iterables. Iterables are arrays, strings, maps, sets but not objects.The most built-in data structure in Javascript are iterables but expect objects.,_
> - _Iterables: arrays, strings, maps, sets. NOT objects. We can work with the spread operators on iterables. It gives us mutiple values seperate by a comma and these value is usually used when we pass arguments into a a function or when we build an array.,_
> - _The Rest Patterns uses exact same syntax to collect mutiple elements and condense them into an array. Rest Pattern is opposite of the spread operator.The Spread operator unpacks an array while rest packs elements into an array.The Spread operator is the right side of equal sign but the rest operator is the left side of equal sign. The Rest element doesn't include skip element and the last element should be the rest operator. There is only one rest operator in ant destructuring assignment. ,_
> - _Short Circuiting (&& and ||) the OR operator will return the first truthy value of all the operands or simply the last value if all of them are falsy. The And operator will return the first falsy value or the last value if all of them are truthy. We can use OR operator to set default values and we can use the AND operator to execute code in the second operand,_
> - _The Nullish Coalescing(??) Operator:null and undefined (Not 0 or '') ,_
> - _Logical Assignment Operators (&&=, ||=, ??=),_
> - _usage of for-of Loop and to get index arr.entries() ,_
> - _Optional Chaining(?.) It controls the property which comes before it exist. If the property exists(not null or undefined) then it will evealute the result. If the property doesn't exist it immmediately returns undefined and provides to avoid bugs. It controls the element which the left side of this operator and often use with nullish coalescing operator. ,_
> - _work with Object.keys(obj), Object.values(obj) and Object.entries(obj),_
> - _**What is Set in Javascript?** Set is a collection of unique values. Set has no any dublicates so they are useful in certain situations.Set works with iterable elements and also set can hold different data types. Set similar to an array.Both of them hold a bunch of values grouped together.And just like an arrays sets are also iterables .But sets elements are unique and sets is irrelevant.There is no way of getting values out of a set,_
> - _ has(), add(), clear(), delete() methods with set data ,_
> - _**What is Maps in Javascript?** Map is a data structure that we can use to map values to key. Data is stored key-value pairs in maps. In maps keys can have any type. In objects keys are always strings but in maps we can have any type of key. Like objects, arrays or other maps. ,_
> - _**Which Data Structure to use?** If you need simple list you should choose Array or List. If you need key-value pairs(keys allow us to describe values), you should choose Objects or Maps ,_
> - _**Arrays vs. Sets** When you need ordered list of values(might contain duplicates) and manipulate data, it will be used arrays. When you need to work with unique values and high-performance is really important or remove dublicates from arrays. ,_
> - _**Objects vs. Maps** Objects get easier to write and access values with . and []. When you need functions(methods) or to use this keyword, you should choose objects. Maps can have any type(not just string) and easy to iterate, easy to compute size and provide better performance. ,_
